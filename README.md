# AI-Powered-Text-Summarization-System

Developed and fine-tuned a text summarization system using GPT-2 and knowledge distillation techniques. Implemented decoding algorithms (e.g., greedy, top-k, and top-p sampling) and evaluated model performance using ROUGE scores. Enhanced model efficiency and accuracy by distilling knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model, leveraging Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face's Transformers library
